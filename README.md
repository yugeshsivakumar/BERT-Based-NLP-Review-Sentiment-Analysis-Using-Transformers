# BERT-Based-NLP-Review-Sentiment-Analysis-Using-Transformers

## Overview

This project implements a sentiment analysis pipeline for customer reviews using the BERT model from the transformers library. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) excels at understanding word context, enabling effective classification of reviews into various sentiment categories.


The project covers:

- Data loading and preprocessing using `pandas`
- Installation and usage of the BERT model from the `transformers` library
- Preparing customer reviews for sentiment analysis using BERT


## Requirements

To run the notebook, you'll need the following Python packages:

- transformers
- pandas
- numpy
- requests
- beautifulsoup4

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install transformers requests beautifulsoup4 pandas numpy
```

## Running on Google Colab

To run this project using Google Colab, follow these steps:

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab by uploading the `Sentiment_Analysis_BERT.ipynb` file to your Google Drive.
2. Ensure you install the required libraries by running the following cell at the start of the notebook:

```python
!pip install transformers requests beautifulsoup4 pandas numpy
```
